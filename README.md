Devops bridges the gap between developers and operations.

Data centres: protecting user information. Super hard to even enter data centres due to high security levels. Custom designed server racks built by Google. Drives Managed in a very thorough way.

### Problems Devops Engineer fix:
1. Ease of use: Other teams are going to use the tools we create. They won't use them if they aren't user friendly and if they don't use them it will make our job harder when rolling out software.

2. Flexibility: Allows you not to become locked in to any one tool and easily changeable as the industry changes. Everything the company uses should be easily to change a business develops and changes.

3. Robustness: As much up time as possible for our company services.

4. Cost: Costs can often be over-looked. Making sure the company is as effecient as possible as we are usually the one's who decide what power of server we use.

We also have a devops risk metre which gives us the likelehood of something occuring and the risk it posses.
