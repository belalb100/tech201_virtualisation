### Dev Enviroment

A place were we can run and test code.
 
A space on a machine designed in a specific way were developers can write, run and test their program.

It is very important for Devops engineer to create this enviroment as we will be the one's doing the deployment so we need to make sure that enviroment fits the devs specific code etc.

Make sure it fits specific requirements.

### What makes a good Dev Enviroment

1. User, friendly, fast and robust.
2. It should be easy to update.
3. It should match the production enviroment as closely as possible.
4. It should be the same for everyone everywhere. Should work on every enviroment and machine.
5. It should only support one application. (Conflict of version or programs. Keep it specific to one application. )
